## 🌐 Branch 2 — Full Recursive Engine

This branch contains the **complete symbolic simulation framework**, suitable for:

- Research
- Game logic
- AI alignment modeling
- Narrative recursion engines
- Deep character/world simulation

### 🔧 Features:
- ✅ Full symbolic engine (`symbolic_engine.py`)
- ✅ World-state + dialogue triggers
- ✅ Emotional, cognitive, and archetypal state dynamics
- ✅ Recursive breakthrough logic
- ✅ Character state transformation
- ✅ Disintegration + recovery thresholds
- ✅ Demo runner with event simulation
- ✅ Advanced symbolic roles (e.g. anima, mentor, shadow)
- ✅ JSON loader + output flow

## 🌱 Branch 3 — Symbolic Toolkit (Lightweight Version)

This branch is a **public-facing**, **non-commercial toolkit** for education, creativity, or exploration.

### 🛠️ Features:
- 🟢 Modular symbolic structure
- 🧠 Emotional and cognitive logic included
- 🌍 Simple world trigger hooks
- 🔄 No recursion engine — but symbolic responses still function
- 👤 Includes sample character (`becca.json`)
- 🧪 Ready for use in web UIs, small games, or simulations
- 📂 Toolkit engine: `toolkit_engine.py`
