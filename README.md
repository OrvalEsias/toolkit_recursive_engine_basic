# 🌌 ErbeSystem Symbolic Toolkit  
### Recursive Identity & World Simulation (Toolkit Edition)

This is a lightweight, open-access subset of the **ErbeSystem** — a symbolic engine designed to simulate **recursive transformation** in agents and environments.

It models how identities and world states evolve symbolically through meaningful triggers, creating emergent narratives, mythic cycles, and co-evolving systems.

---

## 🔍 What Is This?

This toolkit gives you a symbolic grammar of transformation — enabling:

- Recursive identity arcs: `undifferentiated → auxiliary → differentiated`
- Symbolic world evolution tied to character and event triggers
- Growth and rupture patterns for mythic, psychological, or narrative systems
- Modular input/output for symbolic character and world modeling

It's designed for use in story development, games, AI simulation, personal growth systems, or any space where meaning evolves.

## 🧠 Characters (Included)

Each character has:
- Symbolic role and transformation path
- Trait shifts over time
- Triggered symbolic events
- Optional narrative logs and visualizations

| Character | Traits                          | Function Stack           | Symbolic Role | Final State  |
|-----------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Maelee**  | Extroversion, Sensation, Feeling | diff → aux_neg → aux_pos → undiff | Child         | Healed        |
| **Becca**   | Introversion, Intuition, Feeling | diff → aux_neg → aux_pos → undiff | Anima         | Transcendent  |
| **Veume**   | Introversion, Thinking, Intuition| diff → aux_neg → aux_pos → undiff | Shadow        | Disarmed      |
| **Maresh**  | Extroversion, Intuition, Sensation| diff → aux_pos → aux_neg → undiff | Auxiliary      | Wise Fool     |

## 🌍 Worlds (Symbolic Systems)

These files define evolving world states:
- Trait-based regional structures
- Symbolic world-level triggers
- Character-linked disruptions

| World Name         | Setting      | Traits                                    | Sample Event      |
|--------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **The Fractured Axis** | Mythic/Fantasy | Chaos, Order, Faith, Tech                 | `Axis_Tilted`      |
| **Metropolis Verge**   | Modern/Urbantech | Media Signal, Spiritual Noise, Individualism | `Signal_Collapse` |

## 🛠 How to Use

```python
from toolkit_engine import simulate_character, load_world

simulate_character("characters/maelee_recursive_simulation.json")
load_world("worlds/the_fractured_axis_world.json")
```

World traits and characters mutate symbolically over time. Behavior is governed by recursive function stacks and transformation logs.

---

## 🔁 Recursive Model

### Identity Phases
Characters evolve along symbolic stages:

```
diff → aux_negative → aux_positive → undiff
```

### Trait Triggers
Events trigger symbolic shifts based on trait conditions and symbolic role matches.

### World Responses
World state changes when symbolic thresholds are crossed or when characters create systemic resonance or rupture.

---

## 🎯 Applications

- Story generation (nonlinear, mythic)
- Game NPC growth and faction logic
- Personal development simulators
- Symbolic psychology engines
- World simulation and social model design
